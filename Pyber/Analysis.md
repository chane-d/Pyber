# Pyber Analysis

In this project, I analyzed data from a fictional ride sharing company called Pyber. I analyzed the data given to me to determine was a correlation between the type of city and the average fare. In addition to my analysis, I also created visualizations based on the data. These were the key insights that I found:

1.  There is a correlation between number of drivers and the average fare per city. Cities with a higher number of drivers tend to have a lower average fare.
2.  Urban cities have the highest percentage of total rides at 68.4%, this stems from Urban cities having the highest percentage of total drivers which gives urban cities a lower priced average fee.
3.  Even though rural cities had the highest average fare per city, rural cities had the smallest segment of the total fares by city at 6.8%.
4.  Urban cities had both the largest percentage of total rides and percentage of drivers, while rural cities had the snallest percentage of total rides and percentage of drivers.
